# Nepali_Event_Viewer
This program basically shows the festival that occur in a particular date including the tithi. It scraps the data from hamropatro. It is just for educational purpose , if the scraping causes any problem to the website then i will take down the code. 
To use this program you have to install following python libraries and you'll be ready to go:
1> pip install pyBSDate
2> pip install beautifulsoup4
